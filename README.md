# Nusrath Resume 


[**Awesome CV**](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) is LaTeX template for a **CV(Curriculum Vitae)** or **resume** or **cover letter** inspired by [Fancy CV](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume/fancy-cv). It is easy to customize your own template, especially since it is really written by a clean, semantic markup.


## Custom
This is a modified resume by Nusrath Syed.

It deviates from an old version of @posquit0's Awesome-CV and features changes that, at the time, weren't implemented (such as theming elements for colouring entire words).
